						<!-- Questions -->
							<article id="questions" class="panel">

									<h2>Likely Questions</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									<ol>
								<li>Dress code? <em class="dark">Profoundly no, please and thanks.</em> <br><blockquote>Let's all be comfortable and happy, warm enough, and wear shoes
									that genuinely love our feet. I've been told that people in general are uncomfortable when they don't get 
									instructions about what to wear at a wedding, so here's my best attempt: Whatever you would usually wear to have a beer and
									sandwiches, visit a windy scenic overlook, or go to brunch with people you have no need to impress, that's perfect. T-shirt? Perfect.
									Your old fleece jacket? Probably a great idea. Dungarees? I don't even know what that word means, but yes. If it helps, there will not be a
									wedding photographer to immortalize your choice.</blockquote>
									</li>
								<li>Wait, no pictures? <em class="dark">Take 'em if you want 'em, share them if they're cute.</em> <blockquote>We really haven't hired a professional to
									annoy us throughout any of the events we've listed on the schedule. It's not important to us. We will--sigh--be having a little
									portrait session while you're doing your own thing on Sunday afternoon, but it's just the two of us, and we're pretty wary about it.
									Rejoice in not spending valuable time together trying to pose in order of height or look a little more to the left.</blockquote>
									</li>
								<li>Rain or worse? <em class="dark">Weather happens. We'll figure it out.</em> <blockquote>Cape Cod is notoriously bonkers when it comes to weather, so be
									prepared to not really know until we all find out together. If it's raining, we'll adjust. If it's freezing, we'll adjust. It would
									be great if we could get your phone number for last-minute updates about any changes. If you don't think we know how to reach you,
									please use the form below to provide your contact information. </blockquote></li>
								<li>Gift registry? <em class="dark">We're just happy you're here!</em> <blockquote>We are two adults who have combined our belongings under the roof of a
									single house, so for most household objects, we either already own two of them or have recently donated one of them. We are thrilled that
									you're joining us for our wedding, and we don't expect you to show up with anything but your lovely selves.</blockquote></li>

								<h2>6:30 PM on Saturday the 26th</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Convivial and optional dinner at The Canteen on Commercial St. We eat here whenever we're in P-town because it is the best. We will
								be out back in a reserved area. Everything on the menu is great, but if you're big-time allergic to sea creatures or don't eat anything
								off a menu where shellfish predominates, you might want to bring a granola bar in your handbag just in case. There's a menu at the link
								below. Street parking. Sandwiches and beer casual.

								<h2>9 AM on Sunday the 27th</h2>

							<p>
								We'll be at the beach looking for cool rocks and pointing excitedly at shorebirds if the weather's good. Race Point Beach, to be specific.
								There is a parking lot. We know this is early, but if you're up and want to marvel at the great big ocean, this is just about the best spot
								there is. It's peak Cape Cod, a windy and dramatic shore positively bursting with every conceivable shade of grey. Bring a sweatshirt! It's
								possible and potentially pleasant to walk from here up to the wedding site. We may be doing just that, ourselves.

								A wedding! The wedding! This will be the ceremony, taking place on the observation deck at the Province Lands Visitor's Center. Please join us!
								We are extremely excited about this part! The location is a scenic overlook off the edge of the official visitor's center. It's the building
								with all the brochures; you can't miss it.

							<p>
								From the wedding, we'll proceed to Liz's Cafe at 31 Bradford Street for a celebratory brunch. Having a brunch wedding was a considered choice for
								us because we really, really, really like waffles. And toast. And so forth. Brunch at Liz's is where we decided over a year ago that we wanted to
								celebrate our marriage with family and friends by taking them out to brunch at Liz's. We have the whole restaurant for our party, so all you need to
								do is show up ready to eat, drink, and be wonderful!

						<!-- Fire -->
						<article id="fire" class="panel">

								<h2>5 PM on Sunday the 27th</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								If the weather permits, we'll be having a little bonfire at Herring Cove Beach, a lovely spot nearby Race Point (the beach we'll have been to
								in the morning). We're envisioning s'mores, sunset, seagulls, and things like that until we all get cold and decide to head back into town to
								take showers, change clothes, put kids to bed, get dinner, or anything else that sounds nice. For some people, that will be the end of the day.
								For others, it'll be a break before meeting up for a little very casual after-party at a local brewery (details here). Having a fire on
								Herring Cove Beach is one of the nicest things to do in P-Town, so we're crossing our fingers that this part works out!

								Still awake? Want a beverage or a pretzel? We'll be at Provincetown Brewing Company, just hanging out and having a drink and a snack. Come on by!
								They have a decent menu and a relatively comfortable setting for spending time with people you like.

						We've marked all of the wedding events, some practical spots to help you while you're in P-town, and a few things
						to do for fun and coffee! Enjoy (and let us know if we missed anything).<br> You can click through on the map to open
						it in its native Google Maps interface, which is probably easier to navigate.
